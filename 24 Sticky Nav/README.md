## Sticky Nav

It is a project part of JS30 course which has a purpose of making a sticky nav bar with CSS and JS

## Notes 
- When made an element fixed, it is no longer takes up a space in the document.
- Therefore it will look like falling if you dont make up that given space 
- To add padding to our body to make up the space given from the fixed element ``document.body.style.paddingTop = nav.offsetHeight + 'px'``.
- if you make width auto of some element in CSS, it doesn`t make animation. There is no animation from 0 to auto so you need to use average pixels.

## How it looks?
