## Update CSS Variables with JS Project
It is a project part of JS30 course which has a purpose of using CSS Variables, ``change event`` and ``mousemove event``, ``data-`` attribute, ``:root`` and so on.

## Additional Feature 
I added grayscaling filter to the image style, setting its data-sizing attribute to '%'. So user can toggle image grayscaling from 0 to 100.
