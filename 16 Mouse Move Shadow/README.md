## Notes

- When dealing with events, you can get the ``osfsetX`` ``ofsetY`` to get the position of the cursor.
- the ``offsetLeft``  property returns the number of pixels that the upper left corner of the current element is offset to the left within the .offsetParent node.

- the ``offsetTop``property returns the distance of the current element relative to the top of the offsetParent node.
