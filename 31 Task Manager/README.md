- When user set the task as finished, it will ask how many hours did it take to complete for that particular task.

- When a task is finished, it wont show the buttons but only the amount of hours worked for that task. 
- With a button on the top, user can delete all of the completed tasks
- Users can view how many hours left to the deadline and program will alert 1 hour before the deadline.
