## Slide in on Scroll Project

It is a project part of JS30 course which has a purpose of using ``window.scrollY``, ``window.innerHeight``, ``offsetTop``.

``offsetTop`` tells the top of image is how far from the top of the window.

Project is just about detecting the location of where user scrolled in, and add a className accordingly.

**Debouncing**  

use debounce function provided to avoid performance issues, which will just take a function as a parameter and apply ``setTimeOut`` to invoke it repeatedly
