## LocalStorage and Event Delegation

It is a project part of JS30 course which has a purpose of using ``localStorage``, ``e.preventDefault()``

### Event Delegation
To handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated. It allows us to attach a single event listener for elements that exist now or in the future.

## Additional Feature 
I added remove button for each item which erases item from the DOM as well as from the local storage.
