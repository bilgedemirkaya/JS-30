## Type Ahead Project
It is a project part of JS30 course which has a purpose of using Ajax calls ```fetch()```, ``then`` 

## How it looks?

## Note 
I did not use regexp for this project, but I have learned after I watched the course video. It is much better for a clean code. 

**RegExp**

``` const regex = new RegExp(wordToMatch, 'gi'); ```

``g`` is for global and ``i`` is for case insensitive.

Later on we can just do, `` element.match(regex) ``  to find matching words in a given string.
